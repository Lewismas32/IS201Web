        <p>
            Remarkably, my Grandfather and I both started our missions in the exact same area -- The Cavehill Ward in Belfast, Northern Ireland. When I first arrived at the mission home in Edinburgh, Scotland on my first week, I was originally told that I would be serving 
            in a small town in southern Scotland called Greenock with Elder Briscoe. Immediately after this was announced, President Macdonald confessed that he had actually made a change to that assignment and I would be sent to Belfast with Elder Cluff. 
            There I met fantastic people, became aquianted with the great religious tension that existed between the Catholics and Protestants and gained a much deeper understanding of the scriptures. I also gained a deeper testimony that our Heavenly Father supports us 
            as we turn to him. The deep loneliness I felt was replaced as I turned to Christ and tried to look outside of myself. This is one of the areas in which I felt the most growth.

        <p>
            I was elated when I heard that I would be returning to Edinburgh. I spent my first Christmas surrounded by other missionaries in a beautiful city. I was with a wonderful companion, Elder Hatch,
            a Chinese speaking missionary, for just 5 weeks. This was one of the funnest and yet most challenging transfers of my mission. Though I was surrounded by misisonaries who were fantastic, 
            my companion and I struggled a lot to find people to teach. This meant that we had to stand out in the cold for many hours and try to start a conversation with people. 
            As difficult as this experience was, I learned much from it. I learned that I really did have a testimony of Jesus Christ, discovered why I came on a mission, and developed my confidence to get out of my comfort zone.

    <li class="areas" id="Dublin"><h3>Dublin, Republic of Ireland</h3>

        <p> Moving to Dublin so suddenly after a short transfer was surprising. Because of the current laws in Ireland at the time, it also meant that I would not be able to return to the UK for at least a full year. 
            Additionally I would become a district leader. I felt a sense of my inadequacy at the time but over time I began to grow into my calling and become a successful leader. My time in Dublin shaped the rest of my mission.
            After 6 months of serving in my mission I was assigned to learn portuguese in order to support the many Brazilians who lived in Dublin. Shortly thereafter, COVID-19 became a worldwide pandemic which sent my companion Elder Parrott home. 
            I was later assigned to train a young spanish missionary, Elder Barquin, during that chaotic period of time. Though this period was initially quite difficult, it helped me to remember that this was also a difficult time for so many other 
            peoplpe besides myself. It was remarkable the ways I was carried through that time. We experienced many miracles as well during that time, including that one of our good friends was able to be baptized being the first individual baptized 
            in our mission following the lifting of COVID restrictions. This was a cherished time for me.

        Cork is one of my absolute favorite areas because it was the most memorable. I had the blessing to serve there for 5.5 transfers wiht some of my absolute favorite companions. 
        I also experienced some of the most success I had seen on my mission. Of all of the places I served, Cork is the place where I still have meaningful connections to members and friends there.

        <p>After over a year in Ireland I was asked to come back to Scotland to the beautiful area of Dundee. Here I met some of the kindest and funnest members I ever met on my mission.

        <p>After having served all of my mission in major cities I was blessed with the opportunity to serve my mission in the small town of Airdrie Scotland to finish my mission. I loved this area,
            I felt my skills as a missionary were much more fine tuned and I was truly making a difference in the lives of others. I met incredible people here too and again saw amazing things.
            To conclude my mission though the area had not seen a baptism in over 4 years we were able to baptize a new member of the Airdrie ward and make meaningful progress with returning members. 
            I loved those people and I then realized how truly blessed I'd been to serve in Scotland and Ireland.
